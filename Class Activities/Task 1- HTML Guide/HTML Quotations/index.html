    <p>Trials of Apollo: The Burning Maze (Jason's Sacrifice)</p><br>

        While Jason’s back was turned, Caligula wheeled about. He threw his
    spear, driving its point between Jason’s shoulder blades. Piper screamed.
    Jason stiffened, his blue eyes wide in shock.
    He slumped forward, wrapping his arms around Tempest’s neck. His lips
    moved, as if he was whispering something to his steed.
    Carry him away! I prayed, knowing that no god would listen. Please, just
    let Tempest get him to safety!
    Jason toppled from his steed. He hit the deck facedown, the spear still in
    his back, his gladius clattering from his hand.
    Incitatus trotted up to the fallen demigod. Arrows continued to rain
    around us.
    Caligula stared at me across the chasm—giving me the same displeased
    scowl my father used to before inflicting one of his punishments: Now look
    what you’ve made me do.
